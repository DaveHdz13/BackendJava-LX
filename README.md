# Java LaunchX Repo

## Task 1
Download IntelliJ IDEA Edu for building Java projects.

## Task 2
We are using POO with Java. Basic concepts for POO: **Abstraction**, **Modularity**, **Encapsulation**, **Inheritance** and **Polimorfism**.

We had to buy a kinder egg and with the toy that`s inside using it as an example we practice the preview concepts.

## Task 3
Create **Inheritance** with its diferent types such as: 
 - **Single Inheritance**
 - **Multiple Inheritance**
 - **Multi-level Inheritance**
 - **Hierarchical Inheritance**

The first example is in [Animal Package](/src/Week_01/Animal/) as a **parent class** with [Lion](/src/Week_01/Animal/Lion.java) and [Spider](/src/Week_01/Animal/Spider.java) as **child classes**.
